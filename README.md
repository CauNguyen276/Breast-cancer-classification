# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify breast cancer based on the characteristics of cells collected from biopsy samples. We use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models for classification.

## Objective
- Collect and clean data on the characteristics of breast cancer cells.
- Analyze and visualize the data to understand these characteristics better.
- Build and train classification models to predict the presence of breast cancer.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
- Propose strategies to improve the models based on analysis results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The main programming language.
- **Pandas:** Data processing and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Handling array operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** Building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Process
1. **Data Collection:** The data used in this project is the breast cancer dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing and invalid values.
   - Standardize data values to ensure consistency.
3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the characteristics of breast cancer cells.
   - Use charts to visualize the correlation between these characteristics.
4. **Model Building:**
   - Use Logistic Regression for breast cancer classification.
   - Use Random Forest for breast cancer classification.
   - Use Support Vector Machine for breast cancer classification.
5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score to evaluate the models.
6. **Model Optimization:**
   - Optimize model parameters to achieve the best performance.
7. **Visualization of Results:**
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize analysis and prediction results.
